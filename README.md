# Geocortex Web SDK

![CI/CD](https://github.com/geocortex/vertigis-web-sdk/workflows/CI/CD/badge.svg)

This SDK makes it easy to create custom libraries for [Geocortex Web](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxw/).

## Requirements

-   The latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   A code editor of your choice. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Creating a new project

To create a project called _web-library_ run this command:

```bash
npx @vertigis/web-sdk create web-library
```

This will bootstrap a new project in the specified directory to quickly get you up and running with the Geocortex Web SDK.

## Available Scripts

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the project in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see build errors and warnings in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the library for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your custom library is now ready to be deployed!
